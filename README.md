### Hi, I'm Paul ðŸ‘‹

I'm Research Engineer at the [Dynamical Inference Lab](https://dynamical-inference.ai/) building robust and interpretable machine learning tools for decompiling biological computations. Currently, I'm setting up transformer experiments on brain data at scale to study how multi-modal neural datasets can be compressed into foundation models.

I'm also Senior Software Engineer at [KI macht Schule](https://ki-macht-schule.de/), a non-profit science communication organization teaching ML basics to high school students. We provide teachers with [modern teaching software](https://ki-macht-schule.de/plattform) and are the first company to offer fully German-hosted LLMs for education purposes.

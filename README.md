### Hi, I'm Paul ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer at [KI macht Schule](https://ki-macht-schule.de/), a non-profit organization teaching ML basics to high-school students. We provide teachers with [modern teaching software](https://ki-macht-schule.de/plattform) and are the first German company to offer fully German-hosted LLMs for education purposes.

Besides that, I'm researching core machine learning and representation learning for neuroscience at the [TÃ¼bingen AI Center](https://tuebingen.ai/).
